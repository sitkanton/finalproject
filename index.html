<h1>How did it all start?</h1>
<p1>
<div>In different sources, you can find different references to the use of controlled skidding as a way to pass the turn faster. </div><div> Some evidence goes back even to the 30s of the twentieth century, where the racers of the European Grand Prix series took turns with a rear axle offset.

    But everyone agrees that the first country where drift was formed as an independent movement, rather than an accompanying driving technique, was Japan.</div>
<div>It was there in the 70s, on winding mountain roads, that street racers began to master a new way for themselves to get out of a turn with minimal loss in speed and torque. Their ideological inspiration was involuntarily motorcycle racer Kunimitsu Takahashi, an iconic personality for Japan of those years.
     His biography is the best way to illustrate the saying "Everything that is done is for the best." 
    He was the first Japanese to win a stage of the World Road and Circuit Motorcycle Racing Championship, winning the 1961 German Grand Prix. He was the best in Spain and France in 1962 and, perhaps, could have won many more titles if not for a serious accident on the Isle of Man, which put an end to his motorcycle racing career,
     but at the same time became the beginning of a new path.</div>

<div> "You're tense on the track, now you see how hard it is. </div>
         <div> You may be the fastest on the street, </div>
           <div> but until you know the track, </div>
                <div> you're not good enough to drive."</div>
