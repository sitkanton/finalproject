<h1>How did it all start?</h1>
<p1>
<div class="b_info">In different sources, you can find different references to the use of controlled skidding as a way to pass the turn faster. </div><div class="b_info"> Some evidence goes back even to the 30s of the twentieth century, where the racers of the European Grand Prix series took turns with a rear axle offset.

  But everyone agrees that the first country where drift was formed as an independent movement, rather than an accompanying driving technique, was Japan.</div>
<div class="b_info">It was there in the 70s, on winding mountain roads, that street racers began to master a new way for themselves to get out of a turn with minimal loss in speed and torque. Their ideological inspiration was involuntarily motorcycle racer Kunimitsu Takahashi, an iconic personality for Japan of those years.
   His biography is the best way to illustrate the saying "Everything that is done is for the best." 
  He was the first Japanese to win a stage of the World Road and Circuit Motorcycle Racing Championship, winning the 1961 German Grand Prix. He was the best in Spain and France in 1962 and, perhaps, could have won many more titles if not for a serious accident on the Isle of Man, which put an end to his motorcycle racing career,
   but at the same time became the beginning of a new path.</div>

<div class="b_info"> "You're tense on the track, now you see how hard it is. 
       <br> You may be the fastest on the street, 
          <br>but until you know the track, 
              <br>you're not good enough to drive."

<h1>Drift Story</h1>
<p1><div> Initially, drift as a sport appeared in <strong>Japan. </strong></div>
  <div> Since drifting began to develop in several cities of Japan at once, 
     the exact place of its birth cannot be determined. <div>In the history of the origin of drift,
       such mountain passes as Irohazaka, Rokkosan, Hakone and all possible hilly roads in Nagano are known.</div>

        <div> Modern drift, like most professional races, was conducted illegally during its inception. </div>
          <div> The races were held on winding country roads, which were called "Toge". </div>
            <div> The most enthusiastic enthusiasts were called "Rolling Zoku", and they competed on the Toge. </div>
              <div> Initially, skidding was not an obligatory part of the Toge, but, mainly from the rally videos, </div>
                <div> the riders realized that on a narrow and winding road, it was fastest to take turns in a controlled slide. </div>
                  <div> Toge races are divided into two parts: uphill and downhill. Overtaking is almost impossible on such narrow tracks, </div>
                    <div> so racing is a pursuit in which the leader's goal is to increase the initial distance between cars to the finish line,</div>
                      <div> and the pursuer â€” to reduce it. </div>
                        <div> In places where the width of the road allows you to line up 2 cars at the start, the races are held according to classic rules. </div>
                          <div> A more complicated version of the Toge is the "scotch tape race", where one driver's hand is tied to the steering wheel. </div>
                            <div> Part of the Rolling Zoku began to apply rally driving techniques, cornering techniques quickly and without loss of inertia. </div>
                              <div> With the use of rally cornering techniques, </div>
                                <div> drivers on the Toge began to notice that the level of car ownership and passing time improved, while the race became more intense. <strong>It was on Toge that drift originated.</strong></div>
