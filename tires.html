        <div><strong> 5Fivex Gerun 051S.</strong> We start right away with the exotic, namely with the highly specialized brand 5Fivex, </div>
            <div>which is present only in the segment of sports tires. The company is based in the Japanese city of Usa, and tires are manufactured by the Chinese Qingdao Lakesea Tyres. Previously, tires were offered under the Zestino brand, but in 2018, a rebranding was carried out and a new brand appeared.</div></p2>
        <p2><div><strong>Bridgestone Potenza RE-71R.</strong> Japanese Bridgestone is actively involved in various types of auto and motorsport, and drift, too, naturally, was not ignored. Pilots can choose several models of the brand, including the Potenza RE-71R, </div>
            <div>which at one time were positioned as "the fastest Bridgestone tires legal for public roads." Now they have already conceded this title to the new model, which is described belo</div></p2>
        <p2><div><strong>Bridgestone Potenza RE-71RS.</strong> This season, the world's main manufacturer will also supply the 2020 novelty for FDJ - the recently introduced Potenza RE-71RS tires with an asymmetric pattern - large grooves for water drainage are located in the inner zone, </div>
            <div>while the outer one is characterized by increased rigidity necessary for stability in turns.</div></p2>
        <p2><div><strong>Dunlop Direzza ZIII.</strong> Sumitomo provides drifters with its Dunlop tires from the Direzza line. The ZIII model, introduced in 2016, is characterized by the presence of a wide central rib, which improves the response to the driver's actions, </div>
            <div>while the increased contact spot generally had a favorable effect on handling.</div></p2>
